# TV Zone Simple Labels vMix


This version Simple Labels is an application that controls the vMix Live Video Streaming Software. It allows to control graphic elements with dynamically changing text content provided from Simple Labels. These can include lower thirds, title bars, tickers, scoreboards, tables, and virtually any other graphical element for broadcasting.

In the free version of Simple Labels, it can control one Title on input 1 at a time, which includes two text fields that can be independently filled with data gathered from the application. The data entered into the application can be saved to and loaded from a file.

The application has been designed in such a way that it does not jeopardize production in the studio under any of these circumstances. The Simple Labels system can be restored to operation at any time without the risk of unforeseen complications in the output from the vMix Live Video Streaming Software.

If You Find Simple Labels Appealing And Would Like To Integrate The Functionality Of Our Application And The Formats For Reading Data Files With Your Studio Systems, Please Contact Us. We Can Create A Customized Version Of Our Application Specifically For You.

Installation and Configuration
**********************************

Installation and setup instructions are here:
https://tvsimpleapps.com/installation-and-configuration/

If you haven’t installed the vMix Live Video Streaming Software  yet, you can download the latest version. I suggest looking in the following place:

vMix official website  –  https://www.vmix.com

The Simple Labels computer and the vMix computer should be in the same IP address class and the same LAN network. Both machines should have communication open on TCP port 8099. Simple Labels in Free Version uses Input 1 and Titles with 2 text field called "Headline.Text" & "Description.Text".

Simple Labels and vMix can, of course, be running on one computer.
